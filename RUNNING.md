# Running
This assumes you, as a normal person, have the following installed:
- make
- docker
- qemu
- sudo

If you do not have these things installed, this will fail. it is not my fault
that you want to compile an operating system yet do not have these installed.

Run the following command to build and run the image

```shell
sudo make run
```
